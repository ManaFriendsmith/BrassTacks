## Changes ##

- Zinc ore generates in new worlds. Zinc plates are primarily alloyed with copper to make brass, but are also needed to make batteries.
- Brass is an integral part of many early game components like gears and pipes. Gears are also needed in some more products than before.
- Most ammunition needs brass, representing casings.
- Start new freeplay games with a stack of brass to alleviate burner phase grind.

## Difficulty Breakdown ##

All of my resource mods provide different difficulty levels, controlled by a mod setting in PF function library.

# Minimal Difficulty #

Adds zinc, brass, and galvanized steel plates to the early game. Bearings are unlocked with blue science and are needed for more advanced machinery.

With Space Age, Brassteroids will spawn in space, allowing you to obtain brass to craft ammo. Later they can be separated into copper and zinc ores.

Zinc can be obtained from special bacteria on Gleba, from recycling on Fulgora, and from volcanic sphalerite produced as a byproduct of normal processes on Vulcanus and Maraxsis.

# Moderate Difficulty #

Adds a wide variety of machine parts to spaghettify your base: Pipe flanges, linkages, flywheels, hardened hulls, gearboxes, gyroscopes, and complex joints.

Generally, things are a bit more expensive. Some of the recipe changes are eased with Space Age, to make the transition to other planets smoother.

# Maximal Difficulty #

There are now more galvanized parts to make, with a dedicated electroplating machine to do it in.

The affordances to make Space Age easier are undone, and there are now Spurving Bearings to mass produce on Vulcanus.

With If I Had a Nickel, advanced Brassteroid processing becomes a complex process with several byproducts (and your only source of copper from asteroids.)

## Mod Compatibility ##

Brass Tacks is mostly designed with vanilla progression in mind, but contains explicit compatibility with:

- My other resource mods
- BZ mods: BZ resources are merged into several intermediates.

Todo:

- Lunar Landings (Will be done when LL + SA exists and is functional)
- Krastorio 2
- AAI Industries/Space Exploration
- Lunar Landings
- Freight Forwarding
- Fluids Must Flow
- More Science
- Vortik's Deep Core Mining
- Deadlock stacking and crating

Most non-overhaul mods will *work* with my resource mods, their recipes simply won't use any of the new items. Mods that mess with the progression of the game can be more problematic - they may break in unexpected ways if they modify item or recipe prototypes dynamically, or be uncompletable if they change tech tree dependencies. Compatibility requests are welcome but supporting every big overhaul simultaneously is probably beyond my ability.
